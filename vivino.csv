Château de Bellet Blanc,"On the nose it is spicy and with notes of vanilla, in the mouth it shows aromas of pastries, butter, and more subtle tropical fruits and herbs. FIRST TIME I try the Rolle variety, at first you tend to establish a parallel with the reference of a Chardonnay, but then you see that this variety has its own personality. Dry, but with a sweetish smudge, it is elegant and a surprising wine, it is deep and pleasant to the palate. I do not think there are many bottles, if you find it, try it.",4

Château de Bellet Blanc,"AOP Bellet. Light straw yellow, beautifully beautiful. Floral, yellow fruit, nuts, lactic, peach. Very promising nose. Juicy and round my mouth, somewhat creamy and peppery, ending in a bitterness. Balance ok. Yellow fruit, slightly peppery and spicy. Hint of oak and wood use. Good length of 6-7 sec. Do not serve too cold. 100% Rolle. Nice but special wine. Earlier meal wine with buttery sauce and the necessary complex composition. Fried fish or chicken with cream sauce. Wing wood dominates quickly.",3
Château de Bellet Blanc,Super nice wine with balanced sweetness and dryness in the taste. Hint of vanilla / oak with the well-known smoked flavor note. A fruity introduction that moves into a dry aftertaste. Definitely recommendable.,4

I was lucky to taste this exquisite Rosé Grape: 100% Braquet Intense and beautifully dark rosé colored Aromas of red cherries, raspberry, apricot and roses nicely blend together On the palate; soft, smooth, dry with crispy freshness.

Château de Bellet Rose,"Tasting at Bellet winery, Provanse One of three wines presented on degustation - and second place winer 4+ This fine is ready to drink and is far away from regular flat Provanse rose's. Dry, bold and elegant - I think is best rose I have tasted. Elegant and floral aromatic. Could be perfect companion to savory meal, even pork meat.
